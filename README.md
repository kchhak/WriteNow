## Background
Created with [NaNoWriMo](https://www.nanowrimo.org/) in mind, WriteNow is a simple text editor with additional motivators. It aims to remove distractions by not allowing users to waste time playing with fonts and counter writer's block by providing consequences for procrastination. 

The app is inspired by Dr. Wicked's Write or Die, but pared back with consideration to users with sensory sensitivities. The app does not contain any visual stimuli such as flashing lights or colors.

## Functionality

Users specify a difficulty, minute goal, and desired grace period. If a user goes too long without typing and exceeds the selected grace period, the consequences begin and continue until the user types again.

#### Modes

Easy: users are simply alerted with a gentle reminder to keep writing

Medium: randomized soundbytes play on loop until the user resumes typing

WriteNow: if a user exceeds their grace period, words get deleted
